## User Story

Hey! I'm Evan Alioto. I'm currently enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp provided by UCSD Extension. I've always had the desire to learn how to code but never had anyone around me to help direct me, so I decided to just jump straight into it. So far I've been having a blast and the content I've been learning has helped affirm my desires to get into coding. My goals with all of this is to switch careers in order to pursue something I'm passionate about. I hope you enjoy my portfolio page and please don't be afraid to reach out! Thank you for your time.

## Description

My homework for this week was to create a daily planner. We were giving the framework for the html and css and the rest was left to us. I decided to style my in a 8bit retro type font and colorscheme. The challenges of this product were storing the users inputs in their local storage and having it persist thru page reload, displaying the current time using Moment.js, and having the timeblocks style change based on whether the current time is in the past present or future. This homework assignment really helped me become more comfortable using JQuery and even vanilla JS.
